		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Erasmus K1+ “IT Career Start-Up” is an European project which gave to 16 students the opportunity of going to Paphos, Cyprus to learn WebDesign, more exactly HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
To apply for this project, we had a practical test and an English interview. 
We stayed there for 3 weeks and we had a full schedule: in the morning we would “work”, in the afternoon we would do our homework and at the end of the day we had free time.
The project was financed by the National Agency and we didn’t have to spend any money. At the end of the project, we received a Mobility-Pass.
