		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This project is a national one and it involves activities with ecological purpose. 
Through this project, every single student will realise how important the nature is and how we should protect it.
Our school already has the “Green Flag”and that shows how involved the students were.
