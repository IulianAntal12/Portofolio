		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ambassador School of the European Parliament in Romania is a project through which our school is applying for this title of Ambassador School of the European Parliament  . There are 4 coordinating teachers, named Senior Ambassadors, and 13 pupils who have the status of Junior Ambassadors.
Within this project, we need to have more activities with the European Union theme, like competitions and exhibitions.
