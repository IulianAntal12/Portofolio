				<h3>Place: Iasi, Romania</h3>
				<p>We chose this place for our headquarters because it’s one of the most important commercial and IT cities in Romania. The rents are lower than the ones in the capital city and it presents big opportunities because it just started developing in IT just a few years ago. Also, a lot of people that come back from foreign countries want to build their new homes as secure as possible

				<h3>Pricing Strategy</h3>
				<p>We have different option packages, from only thermal control, windows and doors control, etc. all the way to proximity sensors around the house/building, smart cameras that can identify people in their database, an AI present around the house to answer all your questions and commands. There will be different prices for smart house and BMS, ranging from just €800 to €20000 - €40000.
